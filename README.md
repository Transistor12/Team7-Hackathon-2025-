### Backend (Flask API)
```
backend/
├── app.py                # Main Flask application with API endpoints

```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table for authentication and profiles
users (id, email, password_hash, name, role, location, phone, created_at, last_login, is_active)

-- Weather data caching for performance
weather_cache (id, latitude, longitude, weather_data, cached_at)

-- Platform analytics and metrics
analytics (id, metric_name, metric_value, recorded_at)
```
